Simplest and easiest way to compute the histogram of Gray Scale and Color Image in Python.

This Program is written by Abubakr Shafique (abubakr.shafique@gmail.com)
You are welcome for any ambiguities about this program.

There are Two codes in this repo. First one is for Gray Scale Images and the Second one is for the color Image.
It's a basic Python code which just use opencv to access and read the image. If you wish you can use anyother library to read and access the Image and rest of the process will be the same.

Thank you
Regards
